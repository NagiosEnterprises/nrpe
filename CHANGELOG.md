[3.0.0](https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nrpe/releases/tag/nrpe-3.0.0) - 2016-08-01
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**SECURITY**
* Fix for CVE-2014-2913
* Added function to clean the environment before forking. (John Frickson)

**ENHANCEMENTS**
* Added support for optional config file to check_nrpe. With the new SSL
  parameters, the line was getting long. The config file is specified with
  --config-file=<path> or -f <path> parameters. The config file must look
  like command line options, but the options can be on separate lines. It
  MUST NOT include --config-file (-f), --command (-c) or --args (-a). If any
  options are in both the config file and on the command line, the command line
  options are used.
* make can now add users and groups using "make install-groups-users" (John Frickson)
* Added "nrpe-uninstall" script to the same directory nrpe get installed to (John Frickson)
* Updated code so configure && make will work on AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, OS X.
  There should be no errors or warnings. Let me know if any errors or
  warning appear (John Frickson)
* Added command-line option to prevent forking, since some of the init
  replacements (such as systemd, etc.) don't want daemons to fork (John Frickson)
* Added autoconf macros and additional files to better support multi-platform
  config and compile. The default will still set up to install to
  /usr/local/nagios but I added a new configure option:
  '--enable-install-method=<method>'. If <method> is 'opt', everything will
  install to '/opt/nagios'. If <method> is 'os', installation will be to O/S-
  and distribution-specific locations, such as /usr/sbin, /usr/lib/nagios,
  /etc/nagios, and so on.
* Added additional init and inetd config files to support more systems,
  including SuSE, Debian, Slackware, Gentoo, *BSD, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, OS X.
* Added listen_queue_size as configuration option (Vadim Antipov, Kaspersky Lab)
* Reworked SSL/TLS. See the README.SSL.md file for full info. (John Frickson)
* Added support for version 3 variable sized packets up to 64KB. nrpe will
  accept either version from check_nrpe. check_nrpe will try to send a
  version 3 packet first, and fall back to version 2. check_nrpe can be forced
  to only send version 2 packets if the switch `-2` is used. (John Frickson)
* Added extended timeout syntax in the -t <secs>:<status> format. (ABrist)

**FIXES**
* Fixed configure to check more places for SSL headers/libs. (John Frickson)
* Added ifdefs for complete_SSL_shutdown to compile without SSL. (Matthew L. Daniel)

* allowed_hosts doesn't work, if one of the hostnames can't be resolved by dns (John Frickson)
* allowed_hosts doesn't work with a hostname resolving to an IPv6 address (John Frickson)
* Return UNKNOWN when issues occur (Andrew Widdersheim)
* NRPE returns OK if check can't be executed (Andrew Widdersheim)
